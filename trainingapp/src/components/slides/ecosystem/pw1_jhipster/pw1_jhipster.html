		Creating an application
    	<ul>		
				<li>First of all, create an empty directory in which you will create your application:
					<pre>$ mkdir bookstore</pre></li>
				<li>Go to that directory:
					<pre>$ cd bookstore/</pre></li>
				<li>To generate your application, type: 
					<pre>$ jhipster </pre></li>
				see <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/creating-an-app/">https://www.jhipster.tech/creating-an-app/</a> for more options
			</ul>	
	</li>
	<br/>

			Once the application is generated, you can launch it using Maven:<br/> 
			on Linux/MacOS/Windows PowerShell <pre>$ ./mvnw </pre> 
			on Windows Cmd <pre>$ mvnw </pre> or <pre>$ mvn </pre><br/>

			You can also launch it using Gradle:<br/> 
			on Linux/MacOS/Windows PowerShell <pre>$ ./gradlew </pre>  
			on Windows Cmd <pre>$ gradlew </pre><br/>			
	</li>
