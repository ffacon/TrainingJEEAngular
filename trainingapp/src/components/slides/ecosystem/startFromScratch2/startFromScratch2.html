	Start From Scratch - Install Typescript ?
</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
       Once you have Node.js setup, the next step is to install TypeScript. To install it, run the following npm command:<br/>
       <pre>$ npm install -g typescript</pre><br/>
    </li>
</ul>

    <p>
    With <em>typescript</em>, you can decide to transpile your code directly into <em>ES5</em> which is perfectly fine. You can do that by different ways:
    </p>
    <br/>
    <ul>
        <li>
            With <em>typescript.js</em> which will do the transpilation at
            runtime. This is really interesting to POC something directly
            on the web (this way, you don't need any tool, everything is
            done by the browser). It's bad for performance purpose and won't
            let you check for compilations errors before runtime...
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            With <em>tsc</em>: the official <em>typescript</em> compiler, which is the usual way to compile typescript. 
            <em>Angular CLI</em> is using <em>tsc</em>  to provide hot reloading during dev process.   
        </li>
    </ul>
