	Dependency Injection - Introduction
</h2>

<p>
    If an application only consist in a dependency between two elements,
    say classes for example, sure the concept is not very usefull.
    To understand how powerfull it is, we have to understand that it's
    really interesting when an application grows, essentially because
    the developper doesn't need to know everything about a class/service
    to inject it.
