<p>
	What the point with <em>Observables</em>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>They were not mandatory to illustrate our previous sample</li>
	<li>But it's not a matter of observables</li>
	<li>We could use an array as well, as long as the array reference doesn't change</li>
	<li>The main concept is <em>mutability</em> of objects</li>
	<li>When you modify an object, by adding it a field, the object reference remains the same</li>
	<li>Then the <em>OnPush</em> strategy won't work, unless you use the <em>markForCheck()</em> method</li>
	<li>
		An other way to deal with this is to use immutable objects for input parameters:  this can be provided by libraries which will assure that when an object is modified, you get a new reference of this object
	</li>
</ul>
