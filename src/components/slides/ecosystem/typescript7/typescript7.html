	Typescript - Definition Files
</h2>

<p>
    Typescript files generally have the <em>.ts</em> extension.
    However, some files have the <em>.d.ts</em> one, which means they
    contain type definitions (no implementations).
    This is particularly usefull when an existing javascript library/framework 
    wants to be available for typecript projects without the need to rewrite 
    the library in typescript.
</p>

<p>
    In such a case, the compiler has to know where are these definition
    files:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Reference them in the file: <pre>///path/to/file.d.ts</pre></li>
    <li>Put them on the root of the project</li>
</ul>

<p>
        In order to make this process industrializable, you can use
        tools such as <a href="http://definitelytyped.org/tsd/" target="_blank">tsd</a> or 
        <a href="https://github.com/typings/typings" target="_blank">typings</a>
         with <a href="https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/" target="_blank">DefinitelyTyped</a>
