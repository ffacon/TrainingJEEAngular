	To summarize what we have already seen about components
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<em>Components</em> are <em>directives</em> with templates:
		<ul>
			<li>Use of <em>template</em> and <em>templateUrl</em> attributes</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>Components</em> and <em>Directives</em> allow to add some behavior to your app
	</li>
	<li>
		Custom <em>components</em>/<em>directives</em> are referenced
		in templates through their name, 
		and you also have to declare them in order to use them
		<ul>
			<li>
				The <em>selector</em> attribute allows 
				to give them a name
			</li>
			<li>
				The <em>@NgModule.declarations</em> field allow
				to declare the custom <em>Components</em> 
				on which your depend
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

		You can also get references of your directive instance
		in the whole template with the <em>exportAs</em> attribute
	</li>

</ul>
