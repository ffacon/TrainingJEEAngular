    Demo JHipster news
</h2>


<p>
    Let's create some entities with JHipster Domain Language (JDL).
</p><br/>

<p>
    The JDL is a JHipster specific domain language where we have added the possibility 
    to describe all your entities and their relationships in a single file 
    (or more than one) with a simple and user-friendly syntax. 
</p><br/>

<p>
    You can use our online <a href="https://start.jhipster.tech/jdl-studio/">JDL-Studio IDE</a> to create JDL and its UML visualization. 
    You can create and export or share the URL of your JDL model as well.
</p><br/>

<p>
    In our PW the entity "news" could be modeled like this with JDL-Studio IDE <br/>
		<img src="imgs/jdl_news.png" > <br/>
    In order to use this model you just need to download the related <a href="/data/ngecom-jdl.jh">json</a> file in the root folder of your projet.
</p><br/>
 
<ul>
    <li>
        Let's generate ours entities, :
        <ul>
        <li>
                in your JHipster application’s root folder run
                <pre>$ jhipster import-jdl ngecom-jdl.jh</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
               Once the entities are generated, you can launch it using Maven:<br/> 
               on Windows Cmd <pre>$ mvnw </pre> or <pre>$ mvn </pre><br/>
       </li>
   
       <li>
               Important if you want to have “live reload” of your JavaScript/TypeScript code, 
               you will need to run :
               <pre>$ run npm start </pre> or 
               <pre>$ yarn start </pre> 
       </li>
       <li>
               Your application is now running on localhost port 9000. Let’s open the browser and visit:
               <a href="http://localhost:9000">http://localhost:9000</a><br/>
       </li>        
       <li>
               Use Admin account to log in and see use the menu to create some fresh news
        </li>        
       </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<br/>
