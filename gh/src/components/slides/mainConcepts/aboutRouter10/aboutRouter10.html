		Finally, you can also define a route by using a loader, which can be usefull to resolve
		a component dynamically: this mechanism is used for this slides application. Each slide
		is a component which is resolved dynamically by using conventions between the route name
		and the component name.
		<editortab [alone]="true" title="loader-sample.ts" fileType="js">
 new AsyncRoute({
	path: '/your/path',
	loader: () => {
		return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
			System.import('/path/to/your/file.js').then((imported: any) => {
				resolve(imported['YourModuleName']);
			});
		});
	},
	name: conventions.name
});
		</editortab>
		This is particularly interesting if you don't want to declare all your views
		statically in your app, this way you can have a config file to describe your routes
		and load them on demand (it's the mechanism used for these slides)
