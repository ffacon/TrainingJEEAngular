<ul>
    <li>
        <em>ngOnInit</em>:
        Initialize the directive/component after Angular initializes the data-bound input properties.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>ngOnChanges</em>:
        Respond after Angular sets a data-bound input property. The method receives a changes object of current and previous values.        
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>ngDoCheck</em>:
        Detect and act upon changes that Angular can or won't detect on its own. Called every change detection run.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>ngOnDestroy</em>:
        Cleanup just before Angular destroys the directive/component. Unsubscribe observables and detach event handlers to avoid memory leaks.        
    </li>


</ul>
