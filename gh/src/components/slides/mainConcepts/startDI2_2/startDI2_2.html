	Dependency Injection - Introduction
</h2>

<p>
    The non DI sample miss the following features:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        I have to repeat the process each time
        I need an instance of A
    </li>
    <li>
        If the instantiation of A changes (the constructor is modified)
        then each files it is referenced in has to be modified too...
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Finally, the last point which can be very interesting with DI
    in general is the possibility to easily switch implementation to match 
    different environments. Switch between a service which is only available in
    production and a mock service for the environment of qualification.
