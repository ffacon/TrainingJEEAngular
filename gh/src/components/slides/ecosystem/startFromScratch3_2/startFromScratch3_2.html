    Start From Scratch - Install NVM
</h2>

<p>
    If you need to switch between different applications and projects on a regular basis, you may need to install <em>NVM</em> in order to run different versions of Node. 
</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li> 
        Installation is as simple as downloading the NVM for Windows installer from the latest release on GitHub. 
        At the time of writing, <a href="https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases" target="_blank"><em>1.1.7</em></a> is the latest release. 
    </li>
    <br>
    <li> 
        Extact the Windows Installer from the nvm-setup.zip and launch it. (This may require a restart in order to use the nvm form commandline)
    </li>
    <br>
    <li> Use <code>nvm list available</code> to list the Node versions available to be installed
    </li>
    <br>
    <li> Use <code>nvm install 12.13.1</code> to install the required Node version.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li> Use <code>nvm use 12.13.1</code> to activate the version that was just installed
    </li>
    <br>
    <li> Use <code>nvm List</code> to confirme that the correct version of Node was installed and activated 
    
</ul>
