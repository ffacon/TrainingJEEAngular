	Start From Scratch - transpilation
</h2>

<p>
    In order to run your app correctly, your browser needs an <em>ES5</em> version of your app.
    So, what are your choices if you use
    <em>typescript</em> or <em>ES6</em>. 
</p>


<p>
If you use <em>typescript</em>, you can decide to transpile
your code directly into <em>ES5</em> which is perfectly fine. You
can do that by different ways:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        With <em>tsc</em>: the official <em>typescript</em> compiler,
        which is the usual way to compile typescript
    </li>
    <li>
        With <em>typescript.js</em> which will do the transpilation at
        runtime. This is really interesting to POC something directly
        on the web (this way, you don't need any tool, everything is
        done by the browser). It's bad for performance purpose and won't
        let you check for compilations errors before runtime...
    </li>
</ul>
