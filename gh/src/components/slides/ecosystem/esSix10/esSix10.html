	ES6 Introduction - Templates literals
</h2>

<p>
	If you come from the <em>java</em> world (and in fact, from most of
	other languages), you are probably used to format <em>Strings</em>
	with specific methods. In javascript, most of time, this was done by
	just concatenating needed strings.
	
    From <em>ES6</em>, there is a feature called Template literals for that.
    
    Template literals are string literals allowing embedded expressions. You can use multi-line strings and string interpolation features with them.
